4. **Enter Tool Name and Telegram Bot Token**

In this step, you need to:

- Give your Telegram tool integration a name  
- Paste your Telegram Bot API token  

This token is required to connect your Telegram bot with Insighto.

> 🔑 **How to Get Your Telegram Bot Token**  
> Open the Telegram app on your device.  
>  
> Search for BotFather (@BotFather) and start a conversation.  
>  
> Use the command `/newbot` to create a new bot.  
>  
> Follow the prompts:  
> - Enter a name for your bot.  
> - Enter a username (must end with "bot"—e.g., MyShopBot).  
>  
> Once done, BotFather will generate a unique API token for your bot.  
>  
> Copy the token—it will be used in this step.  
>  
> Paste the token into the Access Token field in Insighto, then click **Create** to continue.

5. **Finalize Setup by Clicking Save**

On the next page, you may see a message that says “Nothing to set up here” — this is expected. The tool doesn’t require additional configuration at this stage because it serves as a simple integration point.

> 💡 **Why This Happens:**  
> Telegram tool is used solely to link your telegram bot with Insighto. The actual deployment of your AI chat assistant will be handled separately via Widget during the agent setup process.

To complete the integration, simply click **Save**.
