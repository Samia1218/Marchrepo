# 🤖 Setting Up the Chatbot Tool in Insighto.ai

The **Chatbot Tool** in Insighto.ai integrates seamlessly with **AI Assistants**, allowing them to respond to queries based on your **Knowledge Base** and other connected **data sources**. This ensures your assistant can deliver accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses to your customers.

> 💡 **Note:** The Chatbot Tool must be enabled **if your Assistant uses any other tools** (e.g., Call Tool, API Tool). This ensures that the chatbot continues to respond to general queries even while other tools are in use.
