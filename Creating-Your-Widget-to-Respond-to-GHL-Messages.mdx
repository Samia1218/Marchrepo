# ⚙️ Creating Your Widget to Respond to GHL Messages

With Insighto.ai, you can integrate a chatbot Assistant to automatically respond to messages received via GoHighLevel (GHL). This includes channels like SMS, live chat, and others supported by your GHL account.

This guide walks you through the complete setup — from prerequisites to enabling your bot to reply on selected GHL channels.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you create a GHL widget, make sure you’ve completed the following:

- ✅ Created a **Knowledge Base** (with your documents, FAQs, and helpful resources)
- ✅ Built an **Assistant** (this is the "brain" of your chatbot)
- ✅ Connected your **GHL Integration** via the GHL Tool

## 🧩 Creating the GHL Widget

Once your Assistant and GHL connection are ready, follow these steps to create the widget:

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Log in to your [Insighto.ai Dashboard](https://dashboard.insighto.ai)
2. Navigate to **AI Agents > Widgets**
3. Click on **Add a Widget**

### 📝 Fill in the Widget Details

Provide the following information:

- **Provider**: Select `GHL`
- **Widget Type**: Choose between `Chat`, `Call`, or any other applicable type
- **Name**: Give your widget a friendly, recognizable name (e.g., “GHL SMS Bot”)
- **Description**: Add a short internal note (e.g., “Responds to SMS and live chat inquiries”)

---

## 🔗 Link Your GHL Integration

After the basic details:

1. **Select the Integration Name**: This should be the GHL integration you’ve already configured via the GHL tool in Insighto.ai.
2. **Choose Response Channels**:  
   Select the GHL channels where you want the Assistant to respond. Options may include:
   - `SMS`
   - `Live Agent Chat`
   - Other GHL-enabled communication channels

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> The Assistant will **only respond to messages** received through the channels selected during widget creation. If a message comes through a non-selected channel, it will be ignored.

3. **Enter the Location ID**  
   This is the unique GHL location identifier linked to your account or workspace.

---

## ✅ Final Step: Submit

After filling in all fields:

- Click **Submit** to finalize the widget setup

Once created, Insighto.ai will automatically start responding to messages from the selected GHL channels. The Assistant will reply through the **same channel** used by the customer, ensuring a seamless and unified experience.

## 📌 Example Use Case

Imagine someone sends your business an SMS via your GHL-connected number. With this widget configured:

- The Assistant will detect the message
- Analyze it using your knowledge base and context
- Instantly reply via SMS, without the need for human intervention

---

## 🧪 Testing and Troubleshooting

### ✅ To test your widget:

1. Send a message via the selected GHL channel (e.g., SMS)
2. Wait for the Assistant to reply
3. Check if the response is accurate and channel-specific

### 🛠 Common Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No response from Assistant | Confirm selected channels during widget creation match where the message is coming from |
| Wrong or missing Location ID | Double-check your GHL account to find the correct location ID |
| Widget doesn’t appear in list | Refresh dashboard or recheck integration settings under GHL Tool |
