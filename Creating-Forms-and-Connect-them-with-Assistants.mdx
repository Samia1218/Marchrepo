5.  Add a Text Field to Capture User Name

To create a field that captures the user's name, select **Text** as the field type and fill in the following:

- **Name**: Used internally to identify the field. Avoid spaces. Use formats like `FullName` or `full_name`.
- **Description**: A short helper text to guide the user on what to enter in this field.
- **Label**: This is the visible field name on the form. You can use spaces here, like **Full Name**, for better readability.
- **Required**: Enable this checkbox if you want to make this field mandatory for form submission.

After filling in these details, click **Add Field** to include it in the form.

To capture a user's phone number, select **Telephone** as the field type. Fill in the following details:

- **Name**: Internal reference for the field (e.g., `PhoneNumber`). Avoid using spaces.
- **Description**: Text to guide the user (e.g., “Enter your phone number including area code”).
- **Label**: The visible field name shown to users (e.g., **Phone Number**).
- **Required**: Check this box if the phone number must be provided before form submission.
- **Show Country Code**: Enable this checkbox to allow users to select their country code.

Once all fields are filled, click **Add Field** to save it.
