6.  Go to Model Tab

Under this, the assistant is set to Prompt by default.

The default LLM is GPT-3.5, but you can choose another model from the dropdown.

Adjust the temperature if needed (higher = more creative, lower = more precise).

In the Prompt box, enter a simple instruction like:

> “Greet the user and ask how you can assist them today.” or Add your prompt according to use-case.

💡 You can update this prompt anytime based on your assistant’s role.

8.  Enable Voice for Your Chatbot

Add a human-like touch to your chatbot by enabling voice interaction! This feature allows users to speak their queries instead of typing—and receive spoken responses from the bot in return.

✅ **What You Can Do in This Step**:  
**Select Supported Languages (Max 4)**  
From the dropdown menu, choose up to 4 languages that your chatbot will support for both speech recognition (input) and voice response (output).

**Choose AI Voices for Each Language**  
For each selected language, pick the AI voice profile your bot will use when speaking responses. These voices are pre-trained for natural tone and clarity, ensuring a smooth user experience.

🛠 **Example**:  
If you select Arabic, English, Hindi, and French, your bot will:
- Understand queries spoken in any of these languages.
- Reply in the same language using the chosen AI voice.

💡 **Tip**: Make sure to select voices that best align with your brand's tone—formal, friendly, professional, etc.
