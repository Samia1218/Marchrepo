# 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQs  
 

**Data source status shows "Failed"**  
This can happen if the format of the uploaded file is incorrect or the website crawler didn’t complete the indexing. In such cases, only a few pages may be crawled.  
**Solution:** Delete the data source and upload it again.

**Unable to delete the data source**  
If a data source is connected to an assistant, the delete option will not be visible.  
**Solution:** First disconnect it from any assistant it's assigned to.

**What is the word count?**  
This indicates the total number of words in the uploaded data source. Each plan has certain word count limits. You can check your usage in the Billing & Usage section of your account.

**I want to add another file to an existing data source**  
You can either create a new data source or upload another file to the existing one.  
**Note:** Ensure the file is of the same type (e.g., add a PDF to an existing PDF data source).

**Will the data get automatically updated after crawling a website?**  
No, crawled data is static. If the content on the website changes, you will need to manually recrawl it to update the data.

**I want to connect to a dynamic database**  
Use the **Custom Tools** option under **Tools & Integrations** to set up dynamic data connections via API.
