# ✨ Setting Up the Telegram Widget in Insighto.ai

With Insighto.ai, you can integrate your chatbot Assistant directly into Telegram, allowing it to respond to messages from users in real time. This makes customer interactions smoother, faster, and more automated.

This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up a Telegram Widget.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you create the Telegram Widget, make sure you've completed the following:

### ✅ 1. Set Up a Knowledge Base  
This stores the documents, FAQs, or help content that your AI Assistant will use to answer user questions.

### ✅ 2. Create an AI Assistant  
This is the engine behind your chatbot. It uses your knowledge base to respond to user messages with accurate, context-aware answers.

## 🔧 Steps to Set Up the Telegram Widget

2. Start a chat and use the `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Choose a name for your bot
   - Choose a unique username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `support_assistant_bot`)
4. After completion, you'll receive a **bot token**. Copy it — you’ll need it in the next step.
