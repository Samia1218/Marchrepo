Click the **Start New** button to initiate the Messenger integration setup. You’ll be redirected to Facebook to log in with the account that has admin access to your desired Facebook Page.

 4. Choose Which Facebook Pages to Connect

After logging in, you'll be prompted to select how you'd like to connect your Facebook Pages. You’ll see two options:

- **Opt in to all current and future Pages**  
  This allows your AI assistant to be deployed on all Pages you currently manage, as well as any new ones you add in the future.

- **Opt in to current Pages only**  
  This lets you manually select which Pages you want to connect now. Choose this if you prefer more control over which Pages should show up while deploying the AI assistant.

 5. Confirm Integration and Return to the Platform

Once the connection is successful, Facebook will display a confirmation message. Simply click the **Got It** button to complete the process and you’ll be redirected back to Insighto.

 6. Name Your Integration and Complete Setup

You’ll be brought back to the Messenger Tool Setup page on Insighto. Enter a name for your integration—something that helps you easily identify the connected Page—and click **Create** to finalize the setup.

> 📝 **Best Practice:**  
> Use a clear and descriptive name like `Support Bot – Brand Page` to quickly recognize your integrations later.

 7. Finalize Setup by Clicking Save

On the next page, you may see a message that says **“Nothing to set up here”** — this is expected. The Messenger tool doesn’t require additional configuration at this stage because it serves as a simple integration point.

> 💡 **Why This Happens:**  
> Messenger is used solely to link your Facebook Page. The actual deployment of your AI chat assistant will be handled separately via a Messenger Widget during the agent setup process.

To complete the integration, simply click **Save**.

## Next Step: Create a Messenger Widget to Deploy Your AI Chat Assistant

Now that the integration is complete, it's time to deploy your AI chat assistant on Messenger. To do this, you need to create a **Messenger Widget** that will link your AI agent to your connected Facebook Page and handle incoming messages from users.

 8. Click on Widgets from the Left Panel

> 🔔 **Note:**
