title: "ðŸ“ž Embed Call Widget Setup Guide"
description: "The Embed Call Widget allows you to collect visitor phone numbers from your website and automatically initiate a call using an AI agent. This feature helps streamline customer communication by automating call responses and forwarding as needed â€” all while maintaining a personal touch."

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

When a visitor fills out the embedded call form on your website:

1. An **AI Assistant** immediately calls the user on their submitted number.
2. The Assistant either:
   - Engages with the caller to answer questions, or
   - Screens the call before forwarding it to your actual phone number.

This ensures **instant response**, **lead qualification**, and **better customer experience**.
