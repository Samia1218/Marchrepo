No knowledge base or tools for now — just a quick way to get started.

1. Log in to your Insighto.ai account.

# Start with Creating Assistant

---

2.  From the left panel, click on Assistants.

---

3.  Click the "Create Assistant" button

---

4.  Enter a name & Description for your assistant.

5.  Set the Assistant Type to Chat

6.  Go to Model Tab

Under this, the assistant is set to Prompt by default.

The default LLM is GPT-3.5, but you can choose another model from the dropdown.

Adjust the temperature if needed (higher = more creative, lower = more precise).

In the Prompt box, enter a simple instruction like:

> “Greet the user and ask how you can assist them today.” or Add your prompt according to use-case.

💡 You can update this prompt anytime based on your assistant’s role.

7.  Click on Voice Tab

8.  Enable Voice for Your Chatbot

Add a human-like touch to your chatbot by enabling voice interaction! This feature allows users to speak their queries instead of typing—and receive spoken responses from the bot in return.

✅ **What You Can Do in This Step**:  
**Select Supported Languages (Max 4)**  
From the dropdown menu, choose up to 4 languages that your chatbot will support for both speech recognition (input) and voice response (output).

**Choose AI Voices for Each Language**  
For each selected language, pick the AI voice profile your bot will use when speaking responses. These voices are pre-trained for natural tone and clarity, ensuring a smooth user experience.

🛠 **Example**:  
If you select Arabic, English, Hindi, and French, your bot will:
- Understand queries spoken in any of these languages.
- Reply in the same language using the chosen AI voice.

💡 **Tip**: Make sure to select voices that best align with your brand's tone—formal, friendly, professional, etc.
