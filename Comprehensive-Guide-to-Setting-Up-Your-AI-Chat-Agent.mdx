## 🧠 Understanding the Three Core Components of an AI Chat Agent

Every AI Chat Agent consists of three fundamental components:

1. **Knowledge Base** – The foundation of your AI Agent, storing the information it uses to answer user queries.
2. **Assistant (The Brain)** – The AI engine that processes user input, retrieves relevant information, and generates intelligent responses.
3. **Widget** – The user-facing interface that enables website visitors to interact with your AI Chat Agent.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Knowledge Base

Your AI Chat Agent relies on a **Knowledge Base** to accurately respond to user queries. A Knowledge Base consists of one or more **Data Sources**, which feed information into the AI Assistant.

4. Provide a **Name** and **Description** for easy reference.

### 🔹 1.2 Supported Data Source Formats

Your AI Chat Agent supports multiple formats:

- ✅ **PDF Upload** – Upload one or multiple PDF files.
- ✅ **Website (HTTP Crawl or Scraping)** – Provide a website URL. Specify max pages (default: 100).
- ✅ **Text Blob** – Paste raw text content.
- ✅ **CSV (Text \+ Image)** – Upload a CSV containing both text and images.
