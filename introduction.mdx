## Understanding the Three Core Components of an AI Voice Agent.

Every AI Voice Agent is built on three key elements:
-  Knowledge Base- AI logic that processes user input and generates intelligent responses.
-  Assistant (The Brain)- The AI logic that processes user input and generates intelligent responses.
-  Widget- The interface phone number users interact with on your website to communicate with your AI Voice Agent.

This guide will walk you through each step in detail to ensure you can easily create and optimize your AI Voice Agent.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Knowledge Base


Your AI Voice Agent relies on a Knowledge Base to accurately respond to user queries. A Knowledge Base consists of one or more Data Sources that feed information into the Assistant.

## How to Create a Data Source

Follow these steps to create a Data Source for your AI Voice Agent:

1. Navigate to the "AI Agents" section from the sidebar.

2. Click on "Add Data Source."
3. Select a Data Source Type from the dropdown menu and provide a name and description for reference.
4. Supported Data Source Formats

Your AI Voice Agent supports the following Data Source types:
- PDF- Upload one or multiple PDF files.
- HTTP-  (Website Crawl or scrape data from website)-Provide a website URL for the AI to crawl and specify the maximum number of pages (default: 100).You can also include or exclude specific URLs using the Glob format, a pattern-matching syntax. Click here to learn more about Glob format.

- Text Blob- Copy and paste raw text content from any source.

- CSV (Text + Image)- Upload a CSV file containing both text and image references to enhance the Knowledge Base.
## Finalizing the Data Source:

1. Click the "Submit" button to initiate the crawling, extraction, and indexing process
2. You can track the progress in the table, where the Data Source's status will update in real-time.
3. Once the process is complete, your Data Source will be fully prepared and ready for use.
4. Your Knowledge Base is now prepared and ready to power the AI Assistant.

## Step 2: Setting Up Your AI Assistant

The Assistant is the core intelligence of your AI Voice Agent. It processes user queries, retrieves relevant information, and generates appropriate responses.

## Creating an AI Assistant:

1. Go to the "Assistants" section under AI Agents in the sidebar.
2. Click "Add an Assistant."
3. Select "Phone" as the Assistant Type.
4. Provide a Name and Description to define the Assistant.
5. Configuring the AI Assistant.

## AI Model:

When setting up your AI Assistant, you can choose from the following LLM (Large Language Models):

- GPT-4o mini- Optimized for efficiency and accuracy.

- GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125- A well-balanced model for cost and performance.

- OpenAI o3-mini- Offering enhanced capabilities.

- DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama-  A lightweight alternative for faster responses. 

- (Beta) Groq Llama 3.3 70B-  A powerful beta model for advanced use cases.

## Prompt:

The prompt is crucial as it defines the Assistant's personality, tone, and response accuracy.
You can use this to customize responses, enforce business rules, or define a fallback response when information is unavailable.

##  Conversation Flow

The Conversation Flow defines the Assistant's behavior when interacting with users. You can set up the Conversation Flow to guide the Assistant's responses based on user input.


##  Voice and Recognition Settings

**Speech Recognition Language:**  Choose the primary language for voice recognition.

**Voice Selection:** There are three types of voices available:

- Regular Voices 
- Cartesia Voices 
- Eleven Labs Voices

 ## Fine-Tuning Options:

**Silence Wait Time:** Adjust how long the AI waits before prompting the user again.

**Interruption Time:** Set the AI's response speed based on when the user stops speaking.

**Recognizer Confidence:** Modify sensitivity to background noise for improved accuracy.

##  Tools Integration

You can connect additional tools in this section if needed to enhance your AI Assistant's capabilities.

##  Data Source:

In the Data Source tab, you can link your data to power your AI Assistant.

##  Steps to Assign a Data Source:

1.  Click on "Assign Data Source."

2.  Select the Data Sources you want to include in your Assistant’s Knowledge Base.

3.  Once assigned, your AI Assistant will use this data to provide accurate responses to users.

##  Advanced Settings:

Take control of your AI Phone Agent with these advanced customization options:

**Auto-Disconnect:** Enable this option to automatically disconnect calls if they go to voicemail.

**Forms Integration:**  Connect a form by clicking on "Assign Form" under the Forms section.This allows your AI Assistant to collect user details efficiently.

**CRM Sync (Currently Supports GHL):**  Sync AI conversations directly with your CRM.
Customize which fields you want to sync for a seamless workflow.

**Email Summaries:**  Get automatic conversation summaries sent directly to your email for easy review.

**Webhook Integration:**  Connect an existing webhook or create a new one to automate data flow between your AI Assistant and other platforms.

##  Step 3: Deploying a Widget

A Widget allows users to interact with your AI Voice Agent on your website.

1.  Navigate to the "Widgets" section in the AI Agents menu.

2.  Click "Add a Widget."

3.  Select the Provider (e.g., Twilio, Plivo, Insighto etc.).

4.  Choose the Widget Type and provide a Name and Description for easy reference.

5.  Select the Assistant you created in the previous step to link it to the widget.

For Voice Assistants, you have multiple deployment options. This guide covers Twilio setup, but you can also explore:

**Twilio Account Setup → Click Here for Guide**

**Embed Call Widget → Click Here for Guide**

**GHL Missed Call Widget → Click Here for Guide**

**Web Calling Widget → Click Here for Guide**

**Plivo Integration → Click Here for Guide**

##  Setting Up Twilio for AI-powered Calls

1.  Select the Twilio option.

2.  Choose the Widget Type and provide a Name and Description for easy reference

3.  Add Max Call Duration (seconds)

4.  Select twilio account and phone number to assign to the AI Assistant.

5. Click "Submit." Insighto.ai will automatically configure Twilio.

Test your AI Voice Agent: Call the assigned phone number to verify functionality.
