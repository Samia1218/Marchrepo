## Understanding the Three Core Components of an AI Voice Agent.

Every AI Voice Agent is built on three key elements:
-  Knowledge Base- AI logic that processes user input and generates intelligent responses.
-  Assistant (The Brain)- The AI logic that processes user input and generates intelligent responses.
-  Widget- The interface phone number users interact with on your website to communicate with your AI Voice Agent.

This guide will walk you through each step in detail to ensure you can easily create and optimize your AI Voice Agent.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Knowledge Base


Your AI Voice Agent relies on a Knowledge Base to accurately respond to user queries. A Knowledge Base consists of one or more Data Sources that feed information into the Assistant.

## How to Create a Data Source

Follow these steps to create a Data Source for your AI Voice Agent:

1. Navigate to the "AI Agents" section from the sidebar.
2. Click on "Add Data Source."
3. Select a Data Source Type from the dropdown menu and provide a name and description for reference.
4. Supported Data Source Formats

Your AI Voice Agent supports the following Data Source types:
- PDF- Upload one or multiple PDF files.
- HTTP-  (Website Crawl or scrape data from website)-Provide a website URL for the AI to crawl and specify the maximum number of pages (default: 100).

You can also include or exclude specific URLs using the Glob format, a pattern-matching syntax. Click here to learn more about Glob format.

- Text Blob- Copy and paste raw text content from any source.

- CSV (Text + Image)- Upload a CSV file containing both text and image references to enhance the Knowledge Base.
